# AMBULANCE ALERT SYSTEM
An ambulance alert system that alerts the drivers in the traffic beforehand to enable route clearance for the ambulance.
## Problem Statement
The massive traffic jams in our country restricts the  easy movement of ambulances depriving the patients with emergency medical care thus risking their lives and denying immediate medicalcare.The need of the hour is a smart notification system that can  alert the drivers in the traffic beforehand to enable the route clearance for the ambulance.

## Solution
We are implementing an advanced notification to alert the drivers when the ambulance is at a vicinity of 3-4 KM and thus the drivers can make a way for the ambulance
