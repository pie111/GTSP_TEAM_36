# AMBULANCE ALERT SYSTEM
An ambulance alert system that alerts the drivers in the traffic beforehand to enable route clearance for the ambulance.
## Problem Statement
The massive traffic jams in our country restricts the  easy movement of ambulances depriving the patients with emergency medical care thus risking their lives and denying immediate medicalcare.The need of the hour is a smart notification system that can  alert the drivers in the traffic beforehand to enable the route clearance for the ambulance.

## Solution
An advanced notification system to alert the drivers when the ambulance is at a vicinity of 3-4 KM enabling them to clear route for the ambulance.The system monitors the traffic and detect traffic congestions  and manage them for the emergency route clearance.A display monitor at traffic intersection delivers a notification about the location of the ambulance along with a hardware unit embedded on vehicles with a buzer to alert the driver about the proximity of ambulance.
