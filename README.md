# AMBULANCE ALERT SYSTEM
An ambulance alert system that alerts the drivers in the traffic beforehand to enable route clearance for the ambulance.
## Problem Statement
The massive traffic jams in our country restricts the  easy movement of ambulances depriving the patients with emergency medical care thus risking their lives and denying immediate medical care.The need of the hour is a smart notification system that can  alert the drivers in the traffic beforehand to enable the route clearance for the ambulance.

## Solution
An advanced notification system to alert the drivers when the ambulance is at a vicinity of 3-4 KM enabling them to clear route for the ambulance.The system monitors the traffic and detect traffic congestions  and manage them for the emergency route clearance.A display monitor at traffic intersection delivers a notification about the location of the ambulance along with a hardware unit embedded on vehicles with a buzer to alert the driver about the proximity of ambulance.

An ambulance driver sets the location with the start and destination points before commencing the journey.The location of the ambulance is monitored along with the traffic at vicinity of 3 to 4 km. An alert to drivers in the proximity region is made by the buzzer.A  monitor at the traffic intersection displays the location of the ambulance (Eg: 500 meters away)to alert the drivers for giving way to ambulance.The notification is also  passed to the traffic contol room for further help from police.
